## Project Structure

app/ – Streamlit application  
training/ – Model training and export code  
model/ – Saved preprocessing files (scaler, label encoder)  
data/ – dataset

## Note on Model File

The trained Random Forest model file (`rf_model.pkl`) is not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.  
It can be regenerated by running the training notebook in the `training/` folder.
